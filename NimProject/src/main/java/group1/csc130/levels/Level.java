 * Level contains a turnChoice function, which removes characters from a list
 * of characters owned by the implementing classes, a printBoard function,
 * which prints a visual representation of the character lists owned by the
 * implementing classes, a winCheck function to see if all the character lists in
 * the level are empty, and a isValidInput function that validates the row
 * number and bead amount. There are two functions, getNumRows and
 * getBeadAmount to share the row and bead integers.
